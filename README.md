monaco-editor Display language switching plugin

### Remark:
I encountered an issue with converting the display language when developing using monaco editor. Upon reviewing the documentation, I found that some experts had already developed the plugin, but it could not be successfully translated into Chinese according to the provided documentation. I separately wrote a separate plugin and found that some text displayed conversion failure. After debugging, I found that the plugin package was missing the required conversion data. I then consulted monaco editor nls to resolve the issue.
